## Overview of Integrations

Integrations allow users to link their accounts with external apps, enabling agents to take actions on their behalf. 

You can view all active integrations and monitor live connections or users by visiting the [Dashboard](https://app.composio.dev/your_apps).

Integrations are tool configurations (eg. Permissions to ask for when connecting an account, ClientID/Secret in the case of OAuth) that will be used to connect your users account to Composio.

You can use your own configuration or use Composio's default integrations.

Once an integration is established, it can be utilized by an **unlimited number of users** to connect their accounts. 

So ideally you will only build **one integration per tool or application** and **allow all your users to connect using it**.


## Using Integration ID to Connect an Account for a user

```python Connect a User's account using Integration ID
from composio import ComposioToolSet, App
from composio.client.exceptions import NoItemsFound

toolset = ComposioToolSet()

entity_id = "Jessica" # change this with your user_id
integration_id = "integration_id"

entity = toolset.get_entity(id=entity_id)

integration = toolset.client.integrations.get_by_id(integration_id=integration_id)


try:    
    connection = entity.get_connection(app=App.GITHUB)
    # Connection Already exist with Github. 
    # Now we can check if it's using the correct integration

    if connection:
        connection_integration_id = connection.integrationId
        if connection_integration_id == integration_id:
            # Connection is already active with the correct integration
            print(f"User is already authenticated with GitHub")
        else:
            # Connection is active with a different integration
            # TODO: Choose between the following options:
            # 1. Create a new connection with the correct integration
            # 2. Ignore as it's fine
            print(f"User is already authenticated with GitHub but with a different integration")
    
    print(f"User is already authenticated with GitHub")

except NoItemsFound as e:
    # Create a request to initiate connection
    request = entity.initiate_connection(App.GITHUB,integration=integration)

    print(
        f"Please authenticate {App.GITHUB} in the browser and come back here. URL: {request.redirectUrl}"
    )

    # Poll until the connection is active
