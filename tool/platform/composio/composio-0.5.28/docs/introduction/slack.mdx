<Step title="Setting a Reminder with Slackbot">
<AccordionGroup title="Select the option that suits you best.">
<Accordion title="Option 1: Use Test Integration (Default) - Easy Start">
Just use `TestIntegration.AppName` to use default integrations.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Install Composio SDK
pip install composio-core
```
</CodeGroup>
Use `Slack Integration` to Connect your `Slack Account`
Modify _Composio_ `api-key` by [creating your own](https://app.composio.dev/settings).
<Tip> TestIntegration.*App* uses Composio built-in Integrations </Tip>
<CodeGroup>
```python Auth via OAuth
from composio import Composio, TestIntegration
client = Composio("api-key")
#client.get_integration(**YourIntegrationID**)
integration = client.get_integration(TestIntegration.SLACK)
#Trying to initiate a new connection
connected_account = integration.initiate_connection(entity_id = None)
print("Complete the auth flow, link: ", connected_account.redirectUrl)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Wait for Connected Account Status to be 'Active'">
  If you havenâ€™t, please click on redirectUrl above and complete the flow.
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Connected Account Polling
    #Keep Polling and wait until timeout
    connected_account = connected_account.wait_until_active(timeout=60)
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Supported Actions">
  <CodeGroup>
    ```python Fetch Actions
    actions = connected_account.get_all_actions()
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Using Function Call">
Modify `OPENAIKEY` before executing it.
<CodeGroup>
```python Task to Action Selection
from openai import OpenAI
my_task = "Set a reminder to buy groceries tomorrow at 5pm"
# Initialize the OpenAI client with your API key
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="******OPENAIKEY******")
# Create a chat completion request to decide on the action
response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
tools=actions, # Passing actions we fetched earlier.
messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": my_task}
  ]
)
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Handle Tool Calls - Execute Actions">
<CodeGroup>
```python Executing Selected Actions!
# Execute Function calls
execution_details = connected_account.handle_tools_calls(response)
print(execution_details)
print("Completed Task")
```
</CodeGroup>
</Step>
</Steps>
### Putting it all together
<CodeGroup>
```python Complete Code
## Step 1
#!pip install composio-core
## Step 2
from openai import OpenAI
from composio import Composio, TestIntegration
# Initialize the OpenAI client with your API key
openai_client = OpenAI(api_key="******OPENAIKEY******")
client = Composio("api-key")
#client.get_integration(**YourIntegrationID**)
integration = client.get_integration(TestIntegration.SLACK
#Trying to initiate a new connection
connected_account = integration.initiate_connection(entity_id = None)
print("Complete the auth flow, link: ", connected_account.redirectUrl)
## Step 3
#Keep Polling and wait until timeout
connected_account = connected_account.wait_until_active(timeout=60)
## Step 4
actions = connected_account.get_all_actions()
## Step 5
my_task = "Set a reminder to buy groceries tomorrow at 5pm"
# Create a chat completion request to decide on the action
response = openai_client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
tools=actions, # Passing actions we fetched earlier.
messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": my_task}
  ]
)
## Step 6
# Execute Function calls
execution_details = connected_account.handle_tools_calls(response)
print(execution_details)
print("Completed Task")
```
