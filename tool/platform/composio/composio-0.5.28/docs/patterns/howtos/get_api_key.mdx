<Note>
If you're using the Composio CLI, you can easily retrieve your API key by running the following command in your terminal:
`composio whoami`
</Note>

#### Login on composio.dev and Get the API Key

  Open <a href="https://app.composio.dev" target="_blank">app.composio.dev</a> and log in to your account.
  Then go to <a href="https://app.composio.dev/settings" target="_blank">app.composio.dev/settings</a>.<br/>
  Navigate to the API Keys -> generate a new API key.

Keep the API key in a secure location, it will be used to authenticate your requests to the Composio API.
<Warning>
If you are using the CLI, you don't need to manually set the API key as the CLI manages authentication automatically.
</Warning>

#### Export to your environment

```bash
export COMPOSIO_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

or you can also pass it while invoking composio toolset or client.
