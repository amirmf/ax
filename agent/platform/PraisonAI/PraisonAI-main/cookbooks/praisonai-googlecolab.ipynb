            "1. **Kepler-452b**\n",
            "   - **Size:** Approximately 60% larger in diameter than Earth.\n",
            "   - **Potential Habitability:** Often referred to as \"Earth's Cousin,\" Kepler-452b orbits within the habitable zone of its star, where liquid water could exist. The planet receives a similar amount of energy from its star as Earth does from the Sun.\n",

            "   - **Size:** Slightly larger than Earth, with a minimum mass of 1.17 Earth masses.\n",
            "   - **Potential Habitability:** Located in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri, the closest known star to the Sun. Potential for liquid water exists, but its habitability is uncertain due to stellar flare activity.\n",
